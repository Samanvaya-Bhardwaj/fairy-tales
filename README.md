The purpose of this assignment is to fetch the data from the api of tiny terrible tales, and extract 20 most occuring words in the content and make a bar chart using the information
Then make a button to export the file, on clicking of export button you have to get an option to download that file of top 20 occuring words.
Now I have created a component folder under src folder
Created Main.js file and AnotherComponent.js file under component folder.
In main.js file I have written the algorith to find the top 20 words using fetch of js and to download the csv file, and made the buttons 
then using props i have exported the data to AnotherComponet.js file there I have written the code to create a graph using the data I have exported from Main.js
